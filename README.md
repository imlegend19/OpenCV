# OpenCV
Here, I will upload all my OpenCV Projects.

Till now I have uploaded code of my first open cv and tkinter project. I have made a GUI (using Tkinter) that contains buttons for the following open cv projects:
1) Face Detection
2) Eye Detection
3) Smile Detection
4) Motion Sensor
5) Upper Body Detection
6) Full Body Detection
7) Credit Card Number Recognition
8) Canny image converter

I have made the code quite self-explanatory. Any doubts regarding anything in my code please reach me through my mail id which is "mahengandhi19@gmail.com" and I would answer your question as soon as possible.
